"Perfect clarification ðŸ™Œ
If you **arenâ€™t using any `.svg` files**, but you still get this `RNSVGPath / RCTRNSVGPath` error, it usually means:

* A **library you installed depends on `react-native-svg`** (for example `react-native-chart-kit`, `react-native-paper`, `react-native-maps` markers, etc.).
* In Expo Go, it works because Expo bundles `react-native-svg`.
* In your dev build / standalone build, you need to **add it manually**.

### âœ… Simple Fix (No `.svg` files needed)

Just install `react-native-svg` and rebuild:

```bash
expo install react-native-svg
```

Then clean and rebuild:

```bash
expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android   # or run:ios
```

---

### âš¡ You **do not need** `react-native-svg-transformer`

Thatâ€™s only if you want to import `.svg` files as React components. Since you donâ€™t, skip that part.

---

So your solution is just:

1. `expo install react-native-svg`
2. `expo prebuild --clean`
3. Re-run the app

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also check which of your installed libraries is **implicitly pulling in `react-native-svg`**? That way youâ€™ll know why it was required.
